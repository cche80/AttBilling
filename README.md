Input: the only input argument accepted would be a file with names and numbers
organized in a manner similar to JSON:

1234567890:Jack
9876543210:Tom
...

Future Improvements:
1. Use a list of items for output instead of fixed data member
so that the program can accomodate variable outputs for each
individual. This would potentially solve the international fee bug.

2. More secure connection

3. Sum over a few cycles
